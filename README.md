## My Google Search blacklist for uBlock Origin

A list of websites that I personally don't want to see in Google Search, and a filter generator for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

### Why not uBlacklist?

[uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) is a better choice, but I want to use less extensions.
If you don't care about the number of installed extensions, I recommend using uBlacklist.
